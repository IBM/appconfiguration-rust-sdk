feature management and configuration service on [IBM Cloud](https://www.cloud.ibm.com) for
use with web and mobile applications, microservices, and distributed environments.

Instrument your applications with App Configuration Rust SDK, and use the App Configuration
dashboard, API or CLI to define feature flags or properties, organized into collections and
targeted to segments. Change feature flag states in the cloud to activate or deactivate features
in your application or environment, when required. You can also manage the properties for distributed
applications centrally.
